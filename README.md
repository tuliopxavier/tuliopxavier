## 👋 Hi there, welcome to my GitHub 🚀

A little about me:

- ✏️ I’m a art director and graphic designer with experience in web development with Wordpress.
- 📚 I’m studing Full Stack Development at Certified Tech Developer - Digital House Brazil.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React, NodeJS and Sequelize.

⚡ Fun fact: I love to be on the wild and in front of a computer. How to deal with it? 😵

I believe in a tech community free of any kind of prejudice and that builds a socially just, sustainable, accessible, plural and welcoming ecosystem.
